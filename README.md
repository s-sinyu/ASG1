# NP Ambassadors
this website is created as an all rounder website for Ngee Ann Polytechnic ambassadors and for non-ambassadors to visit to know more about NP Ambassadors

## Design Process
Since this website is for both Ambassadors and non-ambassadors, this website has to have features that caters to both parties

**For Ambassadors:**
* As an Ambassador I want to be able to see all the consolidated duties that are available
* as an Ambassador i want to be able to see the past duties that I have finished as well as the overall duty requirements I need for each semester

**For non-ambassadors:**
* as a non-ambassador, I would want to visit the website to find more about what Amabassador is
* Such as
    * what they do
    * who they are
    * what can I expect if I join this organisation?
