# NP Ambassadors
this website is created as an all rounder website for Ngee Ann Polytechnic ambassadors and for non-ambassadors to visit to know more about NP Ambassadors

## Design Process
Since this website is for both Ambassadors and non-ambassadors, this website has to have features that caters to both parties

**For Ambassadors:**
* As an Ambassador I want to be able to see all the consolidated duties that are available
* as an Ambassador i want to be able to see the past duties that I have finished as well as the overall duty requirements I need for each semester

**For non-ambassadors:**
* as a non-ambassador, I would want to visit the website to find more about what Amabassador is
* Such as
    * what they do
    * who they are
    * what can I expect if I join this organisation?

#### WireFrame

## Features
main page:
- [ ] ambs introduction
    * allows non ambassadors to get a deeper undestanding on ambassadors by having anintroduction page with pictures
    * what do ambassadors do in our organisation, who are we and what we stand for
- [ ] link to (requires login):
    - [ ] duty sign up (details about the date, location, time, number of people required and the number of sign ups already)
    * this is for ambassadors to sign up for their respective duties/events
    - [ ] past duties completed & duty required per sem/overall
    * for ambassadors to see the consolidated that they have done the past years as well as the overall/sem duty requirements for ambs to cross refer to

## Testing
During the testing phase I encountered many problems. For some reason I could not find out the reason why whenever I runned the program the changes were not reflcted as if I were runninng an empty file.

Many of the CSS, JS and even the HTML that I added could not be seen.

1. Login page:
    * Ambssadors will be able to login to their porfile
    * If login is successful, it would take them to the duty page
