                Ngee Ann Polytechnic Ambassadors are the marketing arm
                of Ngee Ann Poly. Some of our key flagship events includes 
                Ngee Ann's very own RED Camp, Open House and Youth Leaders
                Camp.

                We also do outreach events by going to different Secondary 
                Schools and share about the different aspects of Ngee Ann Polytechnic.

            <h3>RED Camp</h3>
            <p>Red Camp is a camp started for 'O' Level and ITE students
                to know more about Ngee Ann and its courses. This Camp
                takes place every year after 'O' Level period has ended and
                takes place across a span of 2-3 days.

                It is fille with exciting programmes such as Course Discoveries
                hosted by the respective academic schools for students to find 
                out more about their favourite courses.

                As Ambassadors, some of the event details we help plan includes
                being Student Leaders (SLs) for the students as well as planning
                the logistics required, the program flows and the social media
                posts to promote the event.
